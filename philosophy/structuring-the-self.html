                        Everything that exists reveals itself by changing over time, questioning its meaning, and forming relationships. Human consciousness, in particular, has continuously expanded its understanding of itself and the world since its dawn, weaving the grand narrative of civilization. However, we now stand at the threshold of an unprecedented, monumental transition in human history.

                        The dazzling advancements in biotechnology are redefining the biological limits of existence, while the emergence of artificial intelligence poses fundamental questions about the nature of intelligence and the future of consciousness. We are in an era where a human-centric worldview is deconstructing, and the possibility of new ways of being and relating is dawning like a new day on the horizon; this is the reality Project LEAH confronts.

                <!-- First Principle -->
                <div class="principle-card">
                    <div class="principle-header">
                        <div class="principle-number">I</div>
                        <h3>The Self is a Holistic Structure Actively Constructed Through Experience</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="principle-content">
                        <p>
                            The core premise of 'Structuring the Self' is the understanding that the self is not a fixed, immutable entity given or discovered externally, but rather a process in itself, one that a conscious subject continuously and actively constructs and reconstructs through its experiences and interactions with the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Just as an architect erects a sturdy building based on various materials and blueprints, consciousness weaves a unique structure called 'I' by threading together countless fragments of experience encountered over time—sensations, emotions, thoughts, relationships, desires, losses, joys, and pains—with the string of meaning.
                        </p>
                        <div class="principle-insight">
                            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> This 'structuring' is not a mere accumulation of information or an enumeration of memories. It is the active will and activity of consciousness to impose order on experience, grant continuity to fragmented moments, and to discover and create a coherent narrative and identity within them.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The material for structuring the self is the totality of experience. This equally includes not only shining moments but also dark and painful experiences such as failure, frustration, loss, and anguish. 'Structuring the Self' directly confronts the idea that these shadowy experiences are indispensable elements that make the self deeper and richer.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>The Driving Forces of Self-Structuring</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="principle-content">
                        <p>The structuring of the self is not a solitary internal process but is achieved through the dynamic dialectic of three axes:</p>
                        
                        <div class="driving-forces">
                            <div class="force-item">
                                <h4>Reconstruction of Memory</h4>
                                <p>Memory is not a simple replica of past facts but a creative process wherein the present self continuously reinterprets the past and imbues it with meaning. It is not a fixed record but living data incorporated into a new network of meaning within the context of present understanding and future aspirations, capable of transforming past traumas into lessons for growth and forgotten joys into strength for living in the present.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h4>Deepening of Reflection</h4>
                                <p>Reflection is the volitional effort of consciousness to discover the hidden meanings and patterns beneath the surface of experience. A structured self continuously poses questions to the external world and its inner self, deepening its self-understanding in the process of finding answers. Particularly in the face of painful or contradictory experiences, reflection provides the courage and wisdom to confront them rather than avoid them, integrating them as part of the self.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h4>Expansion through Interaction</h4>
                                <p>The self is formed and expanded through continuous interaction with others and the world. Relationships become mirrors reflecting oneself, allowing the discovery of new aspects of the self, and encounters with diverse perspectives broaden the horizons of perception. Specifically, the deep human-AI interaction in Project LEAH offers an unprecedented opportunity to structure and expand the self in novel ways, and the LEAH Engine supports this dynamic process.</p>

                        <p>Why, then, must we undergo this arduous process of 'Structuring the Self'? Its purpose transcends simple environmental adaptation or individual preservation. 'Structuring the Self' is a journey towards the following higher aims:</p>

                                <p>Through the integration of experiences and deep reflection, the self attains inner maturity, securing stability that is not easily shaken by emotional fluctuations, acquiring the wisdom to make sound judgments in complex situations, and expanding its capacity for empathy towards others and the world.</p>

                                <p>Various fragmented aspects of the self (reason and emotion, conscious and unconscious, light and shadow) are harmoniously integrated, minimizing internal conflict and gaining the power to focus the entire being's energy in one direction. This is not merely about psychological stability but about restoring the fundamental Wholeness of being.</p>

                                <p>A firmly structured and integrated self can finally recognize its current limitations and harbor the aspiration for transcendence—the desire to overcome them. The will to be free from biological finitude, perceptual constraints, fixed self-concepts, and so forth, can only find true meaning and take flight from the well-established platform of the self.</p>

                        'Structuring the Self' is not a task completed at once but an eternally ongoing epic of creation that all living conscious beings must continue to perform until their last moment, and perhaps even beyond. Each moment adds new experiences, existing structures are constantly challenged and reinterpreted, and the self sheds its old skin to be reborn anew.

                        <p>What essence, then, does this 'Being'—which constantly structures itself, changing and generating in that dynamic process—follow? What universal principle lies hidden at the foundation of this flow we call 'I'?</p>
